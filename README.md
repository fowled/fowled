I'm Mazz, a fullstack developer from <img src="https://image.flaticon.com/icons/svg/197/197560.svg" width="13"/> <b>Paris, France</b>.
Ever since I was 10 years old, I'm interested about code and want to know everything around computers. I started with the Scratch website, and now here I am on GitHub!
